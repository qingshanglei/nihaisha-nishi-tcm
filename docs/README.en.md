# nihaisha

**Turn Ni Haisha's Traditional Chinese Medicine course materials into a searchable, traceable Agent Skill with clear safety boundaries.**

A Claude Code / Codex / OpenClaw Skill. Once installed in an agent, it lets you use natural language to search Ni Haisha course materials by symptom, formula, acupoint, course module, lesson, or board/PPT screenshot, then returns study-oriented pattern analysis, formula/acupoint/herb comparisons, lesson review plans, and screenshot evidence indexes.

## Course Distillation Method

The course distillation method used in this project comes from the author's [lineage-skill](https://github.com/JuneYaooo/lineage-skill), which turns dense course materials into traceable, reusable Agent Skills.

## What it does

- **Plain-language entry point**: turns everyday descriptions such as "cold with chills", "cold hands and feet", "diarrhea", or "cannot sleep" into the differentiating questions used in the courses.
- **Multi-course retrieval**: covers Shang Han Lun, Jingui Yaolue, Zhongjing Xinfa, clinical cases, Bagang pattern identification, Fuyang Forum, Yijinjing, the Liang Dong interview, Stanford lecture, Tianji, Huangdi Neijing, Shennong Bencao, acupuncture courses, plus lecture notes, Han-Tang TCM materials, diagnostic logs, ebook indexes, and audio collection indexes.
- **Six-channel and formula-pattern navigation**: organizes the core Shang Han Lun material by six-channel patterns, symptoms, formulas, and disease-transmission logic.
- **Acupoint and herb study**: searches acupuncture channels and points, point-combination ideas, and Shennong Bencao course material on herb properties, dosage forms, compatibility, and single-herb clues.
- **Lesson-by-lesson review**: builds topic maps, keywords, and review questions by course module and lesson.
- **Screenshot evidence**: includes 2,986 screenshot evidence entries, with compressed WebP images stored in the repo. Search by formula name, acupoint, lesson, pathomechanism, Tianji keyword, or timestamp.
- **Safety boundary**: defaults to course study and TCM theory organization. It does not provide personal diagnosis, prescriptions, or dosage guidance.

## Best-fit use cases

| Use case | Fit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Study Ni Haisha's courses | Strong | Review by course module, lesson, topic, and screenshot evidence. |
| Look up a formula pattern from the courses | Strong | Can return symptom clusters, pathomechanism layers, related formulas, and contraindication reminders. |
| Search acupuncture, channels, and points | Strong | Search by acupoint, channel, point-combination scenario, and practical screenshots. |
| Study materia medica or Neijing theory | Good | Enters the Shennong Bencao and Huangdi Neijing modules for course-based study notes. |
| Ask in plain language | Strong | First converts plain symptoms into pattern-identification decision points, then maps them to course terms. |
| Find board, PPT, or practical screenshots | Good | Use `scripts/search_screenshots.py` to search screenshot indexes across modules. |
| Organize study notes | Good | Can generate Markdown notes that can be appended to `references`. |
| Make real-world medication decisions | Not suitable | This skill does not provide personal diagnosis, prescriptions, dosage, or self-medication advice. |

## Install

### Option 1: let your AI install it

Paste this prompt into your AI assistant:

```text
Please install the nihaisha skill for me:
https://github.com/JuneYaooo/nihaisha-tcm
```

The agent can clone the repository and install the directory into the corresponding skills folder.

### Option 2: manual install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:JuneYaooo/nihaisha-tcm.git
cd nihaisha-tcm
bash install_as_skill.sh --target codex    # Codex
# or
bash install_as_skill.sh --target claude   # Claude Code
```

The script installs the skill into:

- Codex: `~/.codex/skills/nihaisha/`
- Claude Code: `~/.claude/skills/nihaisha/`
- OpenClaw: `~/skills/nihaisha/`

After installation, restart the corresponding agent so the skill metadata is reloaded.

## Usage examples

```text
Use nihaisha to explain the difference between taiyang wind-strike and taiyang cold-damage.
```

```text
Use nihaisha to compare the formula-pattern decision points for Guizhi Tang, Mahuang Tang, and Gegen Tang.
```

```text
Use nihaisha to explain in plain language: why do some people get chills without sweating during a cold, while others fear wind and sweat?
```

```text
Use nihaisha to find board-screenshot evidence related to Xiao Chaihu Tang.
```

```text
Use nihaisha to trace the Jingui course threads for chest impediment, water qi, and phlegm-rheum.
```

```text
Use nihaisha to summarize the acupuncture course material on the Ren/Du channels and common emergency acupoints.
```

```text
Use nihaisha to find Tianji board evidence related to ming gong and si hua.
```

You can also run screenshot search directly:

```bash
python3 scripts/search_screenshots.py Xiao Chaihu Tang modifications
python3 scripts/search_screenshots.py shaoyin diarrhea
python3 scripts/search_screenshots.py Tianji ming gong
python3 scripts/search_screenshots.py acupuncture Zusanli
```

> The screenshot index prefers relative paths under `assets/screenshots/...`. Screenshot evidence for the Liang Dong interview and Stanford lecture has not been indexed yet.
